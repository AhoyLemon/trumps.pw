# TRUMPS.PW
### Where members of the Trump family can enter in passwords to EARN POINTS.

## What?
On November 14th, 2017 I wrote [this tweet](https://twitter.com/AhoyLemon/status/930575343718723585)
![I think my next website is just gonna be a text field with the caption "Type in all your passwords, Donald Trump Jr".](http://trumps.pw/img/nov14th-tweet.png)

Someone named [@dril_shill](https://twitter.com/dril_shill) pointed out that this domain was available, and I let the idea fester(?) from there.

The site is written in [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), with an asynchronous connection to a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) realtime db. It is insecure by design.

## Is that it?
Yeah, I think that covers it. Bye for now!
