<p>On November 14th, 2017 I wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/AhoyLemon/status/930575343718723585">this tweet</a>

<p>Someone named <a href="https://twitter.com/dril_shill">@dril_shill</a> pointed out that this domain was available, and I let the idea fester(?) from there.</p>
<p>The site is written in <a href="https://github.com/pugjs/pug">Pug</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue">Vue</a>, with an asynchronous connection to a <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> realtime db. It is insecure by design.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that covers it. Bye for now!</p>
